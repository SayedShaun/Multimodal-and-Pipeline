## Multimodal and Pipeline

This project is aimed at creating a pipeline for handling multimodal data, focusing on vision data modalities. It includes tools for processing and training models using this data.

### Sample Data

- **data_pipeline.py**: This Python script contains functions and classes for building and managing the data pipeline. It handles data loading, preprocessing, and transformation tasks necessary for feeding the data into the models.

- **train.py**: This Python script is responsible for training the models. It imports the necessary modules, sets up the training environment, and executes the training process using the specified model architecture and training data.

- **vision_model.py**: This Python script defines the architecture of the vision model. It includes classes for building, compiling, and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other vision-related models.


### Dependencies

- Python 3.10
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
